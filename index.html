<div class="step slide" data-x="-400" data-y="-300" data-rotate="1" data-scale="0.8854999999999998"><b class="positioning">Principle 1 - Enable Benefits and Business Change</b><br /><br />  To enable the delivery of business change through technology and support the realisation of benefits expressed in new IT projects and programmes including Paperless 2020. This will be achieved through quality assurance and measurement of stakeholder satisfaction e.g. quality checks that performance testing meets current and known future volumes.  NHS Digital Test and Assurance delivers and supports continuous service improvement.</div>
<div class="step slide" data-x="612" data-y="-299" data-rotate="0" ><b>Principle 2 - Managing Risk</b><br /><br />  To deliver confidence that NHS Digital services operate as intended and do not expose patients or NHS and social care organisations to unacceptable risk â€“ including clinical  safety,  technical, information security and reputational risk.</div>
<div class="step slide" data-x="230" data-y="491" data-rotate="51.42857142857143" data-scale="1"><b>Principle 3 - Delivering Confidence through Assurance</b><br /><br />  To provide formal assurance that new and enhanced technology is safe to proceed to live service and ensure appropriate risk management is in place enabling an informed decision by the Chief Operating Officer (COO).<br />The assurance statement provides Service Management with a status and recommendation derived from a risk based assessment, raises appropriate concerns relating to the commencement to live operation of the IT service and, by exception, escalates to the Operations Board then COO. Engagement by programmes (including SRO or equivalent) with NHS Digital Test and Assurance is therefore a mandatory pre-requisite of successful delivery.</div>
<div class="step slide" data-x="-625" data-y="686" data-rotate="102.85714285714286" data-scale="1"><b>Principle 4 - Effective Collaboration</b><br /><br />  To deliver streamlined test and assurance services  for digital services developed wholly or collaboratively by NHS Digital, working with internal development teams by agreement to ensure test and assurance practices are effective and delivered with minimal cost and duplication.</div>
<div class="step slide" data-x="-1311" data-y="139" data-rotate="154.28571428571428" data-scale="1"><b>Principle 5 - Empowering Local Ownership</b><br /><br />  The assurance of local and regional systems delivered outside any formal agreement or sponsorship with NHS Digital is entirely the responsibility of the commissioner/SRO; except for those systems that integrate with the National Services and which are therefore subject to the principles above including agreement of a risk based assurance approach to protect the live operation of the National Services. NHS Digital Solution Test and Assurance remit may extend beyond the above principles when, for example, commissioned to provide test services or assure local/regional system compliance with requirements above and beyond protection of national systems.</div>
<div class="step slide" data-x="-1311" data-y="-739" data-rotate="205.71428571428572" data-scale="1"><b>Principle 6 - Championing Safety and Standards</b><br /><br />  NHS Digital Solution Test and Assurance enables and champions interoperability and the adoption of and compliance with national standards. Technical and clinical safety assurance is conducted according to equitable, transparent and repeatable processes based on identification and mitigation of risk in support of national standards SCCI 0129 and SCCI 0160. NHS Digital Test practices align to the principles detailed in ISO29119.</div>
<div class="step slide" data-x="-625" data-y="-1286" data-rotate="257.14285714285717" data-scale="1"><b>Principle 7 - User-Centric Approach</b><br /><br />  The detailed scope of test and assurance is through agreement in line with the assurance principles. In addition, agreement is made with the engaging programme sponsor/ SRO and Programme Director based on the agreed risk profile aligned to the risk areas set out in Principles 2 & 3 and the Service Acceptance Criteria. Functional and non-functional testing is based, where applicable, on acceptance criteria specified by the programme to represent meaningful business use.</div>
